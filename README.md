# Inspirations

Svelte being one of the modern frameworks that I have hooked the most, and seeing no ongoing projects for social buttons, needing them personally, I set out to create what I needed, and at the same time share this work with other developers.
Many projects have inspired me, in particular **Svelma**, a library of components with the "Bulma" css framework.

All my sources are available in the components in question.

I hate librairies with a lot of dependencies, so I did a librairy with just ``Svelte`` as dependency.

# Quick Start

```
npm install --save svecial
```

Import components like:

```js
import { GoogleButton } from 'svecial'
```

## SSR

``Svecial`` supports SSR. If you get any error when compiling, please compare your ``rollup.config.js`` file with Svecial doc's config.

 > Special thanks to [@matyunya](https://github.com/matyunya) for taking his time to help me create the SSR part
